  ## Description  
  In this assignment, I modified starter code to create an application called 'Note Taker' that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back-end and will save and retrieve data from a JSON file. This application's front-end has already been created. It was my job to build the back-end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

  ## User Story  
  `AS A small business owner  
  I WANT to be able to write and save notes  
  SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete`  
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  `GIVEN a note-taking application  
  WHEN I open the Note Taker  
  THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page  
  WHEN I click on the link to the notes page  
  THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column  
  WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text  
  THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page  
  WHEN I click on the Save icon  
  THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes  
  WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column  
  THEN that note appears in the right-hand column  
  WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page  
  THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column`
